The codes contained in this repository are programs that I have been working on to help me learn # Python

In this repository you will find a program that can take a short DNA or RNA sequence and perform a few actions depending 
on the inputs of the user. These actions include counting bases, translating an RNA Sequence or transcribing a DNA sequence. 

As I gain more skills in python I will be uploading more advanced programs that can take documents and translate, transcribe or manipulate 
sequences conainted in the document and export them to a new document. 

Further projects I have planned include a program that can search for specific sequences and export them to a specified document. 

These features are already available through extenstions like biopython, but these projects are to help me understand and learn python.
