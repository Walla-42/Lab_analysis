# Laboratory Data Analysis Scripts

This repository contains Python scripts I developed to analyze laboratory data and explore biological and chemical datasets. Each script reflects my progress in learning Python and its application to solving practical problems in biology and chemistry.

## Scripts Overview

### 1. **BIOID_Time_Calculator**
   - A utility script to calculate time points for performing specific experimental steps in BIOID assays.
   - Helped me learn and implement the `datetime` module in Python.

### 2. **Chem_Functions**
   - A collection of functions I used regularly in my analytical chemistry lab, including:
     - Buoyancy correction.
     - Density calculation.
     - Equivalence point calculation for potentiometric titrations.

### 3. **FNA_Parse**
   - A parser for `.fna` files containing multiple DNA sequences.
   - Allows users to select specific DNA sequences and save them as separate `.fna` files for future analysis.

### 4. **Integration**
   - Implements numerical integration techniques to calculate the area under a curve:
     - Trapezoidal rule.
     - Simpson's rule.

### 5. **Sequences_from_FASTA**
   - Analyzes DNA, RNA, or protein sequences from a FASTA file.
   - Features include:
     - Transcription of DNA to RNA.
     - k-mer analysis.
     - Reverse complement strand generation.
   - One of my first Python programs, marking the start of my programming journey.

### 6. **Single_Exon_Gene_Search**
   - Compares genome files with protein sequences to find matches.
   - Specifically designed for single-exon genes without post-transcriptional or post-translational modifications.
   - A stepping stone project to explore the Biopython library.

## Notes

- As I continue to develop more programs and learn additional languages, I will update this repository.
- This repository serves as a running portfolio, documenting my journey in applying programming approaches to solve biological and chemical problems.

Feedback and suggestions are always welcome!
