The codes contained in this repository are scripts that I have used to analyze my lab data and explore biological and chemical data. 

**<u>Codes:</u>**  

**BIOID_Time_Calculator:** This script is to help me determine the time points where I must perform specific parts of my experiment. This also helped me learn the date/time module.  

**Chem_functions:** These are funcitions I used daily in my analytical chemistry lab. Functions included are bouyancy correction, density calculator, and an equivalency point calculatory for potentiometric titrations.   

**fna_parse:** This script contains a function I created to parse .fna files that contain multiple DNA files. It allows you to also select the dna file you want to work with and saves it as its own .fna file for future analysis.  

**Integration:** This script recreates the functions used to calculate the area under a curve. This file recreates the trapizoidal rule of integration and the simpsons rule of integration.   

**Sequences_from_FASTA:** This script allows you to analyze a DNA, RNA or protein sequence from a fasta file and perform actions such as transcribe, analyze k-mers, give the reverse complement strand and more. This program was one of my first programs I worked on while learning python.   

**single_exon_gene_search:** This program takes a genome file and a protein sequences and analyzes the two to find a match within the genome. This program only works for sequences that are created by single exons, and have no post transcriptional/tranlational modifictions. Although it is very limited in its use, it was a stepping stone to help me learn more about the Biopython library.   


***As I create more programs and learn more languages, I will update this repository. This is like a running portfolio detailing my journey in learning programing approaches to solving chemical and biological problems. ***
